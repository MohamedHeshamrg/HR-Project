ðŸ“Š Key Insights from Employee Data Analysis
ðŸŽ¯ Employee Exit Reasons:
The most common reasons behind employee turnover are:

Low salary levels

High work pressure

ðŸ’¼ Departmental Structure & Roles:
The Customer Service department has an unusually high number of:

Senior Staff (161,934)

Staff (152,957)

This strongly indicates a significant expansion in customer operations.

The majority of employees are Engineers, and the Development department is the largest by headcount.

Staff salaries may be the salaries of the manager.

ðŸ’° Salary Analysis:
Sales employees have the highest salaries in the company.

There is a large salary gap between Development, Production, and Sales compared to other departments.

Development and Production departments are underpaid relative to their workload and impact â€” a salary increase is recommended.

The current annual salary raise rate needs improvement to better retain talent.

Salary equality exists between males and females â€” no signs of gender-based bias.

Seniority and loyalty are not reflected enough in salary levels, and there should be a stronger link between tenure and compensation.

ðŸ‘¥ Turnover & Retention:
The highest number of employee exits occurred in the year 2000.

The departments with the highest turnover rates are:

Development

Production

Sales

These same departments also have the highest hiring rates, indicating high activity and possibly a high-pressure environment.

In contrast, the Customer Service department has the lowest turnover, showing more stability.

Over 40% of employees have stayed more than 10 years, suggesting long-term commitment and a generally stable workforce.

ðŸ“… Hiring Patterns:
Hiring happens throughout the year, with no strong seasonality.

The high overall hiring rate is a clear sign of company growth and expansion.

ðŸŽ‚ Employee Age Distribution:
Average age: 43.5 years

Youngest: 37 years

Oldest: 50 years

Standard deviation: 3.77

The company shows a healthy age distribution across the workforce.

ðŸ§© Summary of Key Takeaways:
The company is experiencing rapid growth, evident from high hiring rates across multiple departments, especially in Development, Sales, and Production. However, these same departments are also seeing higher exit rates, likely due to salary dissatisfaction and workload stress. While salaries are fair by gender, there are noticeable disparities across departments, and stronger rewards for tenure and loyalty are needed.

On a positive note, the company has managed to maintain employee retention in several areas, especially in Customer Service, and continues to attract employees year-round. The overall age distribution is balanced, and a large portion of the workforce is highly experienced, with many staying over a decade. Moving forward, the company should focus on enhancing compensation strategies and reducing pressure in high-turnover departments to maintain sustainable growth.
